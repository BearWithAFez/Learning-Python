# Learning Python

In this 'lil repo I'll just post some excercises and goals of me learnin Python.
I'm using [this book](https://www.vanduurenmedia.nl/EAN/9789059409743/Handboek_Python).

All excercises are sort of made up on the spot and devided on how far I'm in the book.

Feel free to contact me if anything comes up.
